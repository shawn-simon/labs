Arrays

Sorting takes nlogn time

Strings

1.1 When looping thru strings, use charAt instead of split()

LinkedList

2.7 My solution is fast and easy, but only because it's in JavaScript. Maybe re-read this one later.

Random

1.1 Instead of using a dictionary (which is I believe the same as a hash?) I could have used an array of booleans if they are ascii characters. TODO: Look up difference in lookup time and construction of an array vs a dictionary.

1.8  Has a cool substring rotation trick.


2.1 When they ask for an alternate solution that takes less storage space, sometimes a n^2 solution is fine.

Notes

3.1 I didn't complete the followup's code. Can be done pretty easy in JS with splice.
